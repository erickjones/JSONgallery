<h2>JSONgallery w/ JQuery</h2>
<br>
<b>You need to check it in your localHost.</b>

This image gallery is crossBrowser - [feel free to notify about any browser incompatibilities]

I used jQuery getJSON method to catch it and stored in an Array. Then when the user clicks a button the img src is updated to the next image/item stored in the Array.

Also when user mouseOver the arrows buttons, it dispatches the animation in button's css.

<b>Now with slideShow and a progress bar to indicate when the picture will change.</b>

Feel free to fork it.
