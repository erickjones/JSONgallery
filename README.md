JSONgallery w/ JQuery = function(){
	
	This image gallery is crossBrowser - [feel free to notify about any browser incompatibilities]

	I used jQuery getJSON method to catch it and stored in an Array. Then when the user clicks a button the img src is updated to the next image/item stored in the Array.

	Also when user mouseOver the arrows buttons, it dispatches the animation in button css.

	Feel free to fork it.
